# Analysis of School District Test Scores
## Purpose
###### This analysis was performed to measure the impact of removal of suspicious scores from Thomas High 9th grade students from a data set consisting of students, reading and math grades, as well as schools, school sizes and budgets.

## Results of Changes
  * #### Changes in District Summary
    The average math score only decreased by a tenth of a percent, with each passing percentage decreasing by one full percent.

  * #### Changes in School Summary
    Thomas High's scores went from 93.3 to 69.9 for math, 97.3 to 69.7 for reading, and 90.9 to 65.0 for overall passing percentages. This discrepancy is quite large, statistically. No other data from other schools were changed.

  * #### Thomas High School's Performance
    After the suspect scores were dropped, Thomas High no longer appears to be the second best school. It does not get pushed to the bottom five, instead it is somewhere in the middle.
