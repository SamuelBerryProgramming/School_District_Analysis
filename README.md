# Analysis of School District Test Scores
## Purpose
###### This analysis was performed to measure the impact of removal of suspicious scores from Thomas High 9th grade students from a data set consisting of students, reading and math grades, as well as schools, school sizes and budgets.

## Results of Changes
  * #### Changes in District Summary
    The average math score only decreased by a tenth of a percent, with each passing percentage decreasing by one full percent.    
  * #### Changes in School Summary
    Thomas High's scores went from 93.3 to 69.9 for math, 97.3 to 69.7 for reading, and 90.9 to 65.0 for overall passing percentages. This discrepancy is quite large, statistically. No other data from other schools were changed.     
  * #### Thomas High School's Performance
    After the suspect scores were dropped, Thomas High no longer appears to be the second best school. It does not get pushed to the bottom five, instead it is somewhere in the middle. 
  * #### Other Effects of Omission of Scores
   * Scores for all other reading and math tests remain the same, as only the scores of the 9th grade class of Thomas High were dropped.
   * The only spending range affected was $630-644, with rounded averages remaining the same and percentage passing decreasing by 6% for math, 7% for reading, and 6% overall.
   * Passing percentages decreased for medium sized schools, 6% for math, 6% for reading, and 6% overall.
   * Passing percentages diminished for charter schools, 4% for math, 4% for reading, and 3% overall.
   
## Summary of Changes
 While averages were largely unchanged, passing percentages of Thomas High, the $630-644 student spending range, charter schools, and medium size schools were all reduced after the suspicious scores were removed.
